# Dev Null - Complete Battlebot Project

Main repository for Dev Null battlebot - Where opponents go to `/dev/null` ⚔️

> Built by IT geeks who know how to make things disappear into the void.

## Overview

Dev Null is a battlebot project that combines our passion for technology with competitive robot combat. This repository aggregates both hardware and software components using Git submodules.

## Architecture

This project uses a modular approach with separate repositories:

- **Hardware** (`devnull-hardware/`): CAD designs, mechanical components, manufacturing files
- **Software** (`devnull-software/`): Firmware, control systems, electronics schematics

## Getting Started

### Clone with Submodules

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/VirtuallyScott/devnull-all.git
```

Or if you've already cloned:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Development Workflow

Each component can be developed independently:

1. **Hardware Development**: Work in `devnull-hardware/` directory
2. **Software Development**: Work in `devnull-software/` directory

## Resources

- **BattleBots Design Guide**: https://book.battlebots.com/
- **Safety Protocols**: Always follow proper safety when building and testing

## Development Team

Built by passionate IT professionals who channel their debugging skills into robot destruction.

## Getting Involved

Both repositories use Git Flow for branching strategy. See individual READMEs for specific contribution guidelines.
